This talk has nothing about category theory. It doesn't talk about
type-level programming or type classes (even though Frameless relies
heavily on both).

Instead, this talk:

::: incremental

- ...is a gentle introduction to Apache Spark.
- ...compares and contrasts the standard Spark DataFrames and Datasets APIs 
  with the Typelevel Frameless API.
- It's oriented toward learning how to _use_ these APIs.
- Hopefully, at the end:
    - you'll walk away with some understanding of Spark (if you don't already 
      know it) 
    - and you'll have some idea of how Frameless compares to the native
      Spark APIs.

# This is the last slide {class="slide-title" data-background-image="images/normal-bg.png"}

This talk will be largely demo-oriented, using Databricks notebooks.

The source to these slides and to all the notebooks are in GitHub repo  
`github.com/bmc/spark-frameless-talk-2018`

The README in that repo explains how to run the notebooks yourself, if
you want to do so.
